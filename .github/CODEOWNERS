# ================================================
#  Concepts
# ================================================
#
# 1. A CodeOwner should only review what they are comfortable reviewing. If you're not comfortable, say something.
# 2. It is a CodeOwners responsibility to only accept the changes that they understand and deem necessary.
# 3. The CodeOwners have final say on whether or not code is accepted.
# 4. If multiple CodeOwners are listed, ALL code owners must approve the PR prior to merge.
# 5. CodeOwners work in conjunction with Github's "Number of Required Approvals (1)" requirement.
